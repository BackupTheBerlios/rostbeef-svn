* to compile the project execute 'build.sh' or 'build.bat' from within this 
  directory
* if you need to add a new source file put it into folder 'src' and make sure
  to supply a compile directive at 'Emakefile'
* to make your modules available under ejabberd either copy the contents of the
  'ebin' directory to your ejabberd's installation directory (where all of its
  beam files reside) or (prefered) add the path to this ebin directory to your
  ejabberd's start script. This is accomplished by using the parameter '-pa'
  to the erl command (see 'man erl' for details).
* to make ejabberd actually use the module you need to add an entry to the 
  modules directive of its configuration file like this

{modules,
 [
...
{mod_rostbeef, []}
...
 ]}
